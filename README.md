Card Game War in Java (IntelliJ)
  -- Uses 52 card deck with no Joker
  -- Two players take cards out of their decks and do a comparison, and the one that has higher value, takes both cards
  -- In occurence of tie during war (where the two card faced upwards are of equal value) It checks the value of the next card in the deck,
     and whoever has the higher face value, collects all card placed during the war.
       --- If another tie breaker happens, instead of checking the next available card, I chose to look at suit and color instead, in order 
           to shorten the possibility of multiple ties in a row. Although it would be really rare for multiple tiebreakers to happen in order.
